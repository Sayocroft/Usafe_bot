    st.write("""
    A hate crime (also known as a bias crime) occurs when a perpetrator targets a victim based on their physical appearance or perceived membership in a specific social group. 
    These groups may include race, ethnicity, disability, language, nationality, political views, age, religion, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.
    Non-criminal actions motivated by these biases are termed "bias incidents." Examples of hate crimes include physical assault, homicide, property damage, bullying, harassment, 
    verbal abuse, offensive graffiti, or hate mail.

    The term **"hate crime"** gained prominence in the U.S. during the 1980s, although such crimes have existed throughout history:
    - Roman persecution of Christians.
    - Nazi genocide of Jews.
    - European colonial violence against indigenous peoples.
    - In the U.S., lynchings, cross burnings, and attacks on ethnic minorities and LGBTQ+ communities were common.
    - More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a surge in anti-Chinese violence, as documented by organizations like the [NEVER AGAIN Association](https://www.nigdywiecej.org) in Poland.

    # Section 3: Motivation Behind Hate Crimes
    st.subheader("üîç Motivation Behind Hate Crimes")
    st.markdown("""
    Sociologists like Jack McDevitt and Jack Levin identify primary motives behind hate crimes:
    - **Thrill-seeking**: Committed for excitement, often by groups targeting vulnerable individuals.
    - **Defensive motives**: Aimed at protecting one‚Äôs community from perceived threats.
    - **Retaliatory motives**: Driven by revenge for perceived offenses.
    - **Mission-oriented crimes**: Ideologically motivated, often targeting symbolically significant sites.
    
    The **Self-Control Theory** offers insights into hate crime motivations, suggesting that social, cultural, and individual factors contribute to these biases. 
    Offenders often develop biases through social interactions and biased media exposure.
