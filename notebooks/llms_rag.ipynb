      "\t* Explain the details of the incident to the officer and let them know you believe it to be a hate crime\n",
      "\t* The police will create an official report based on your statement and evidence\n",

      "\t* For Berlin residents, you can use the Berlin Police Online Reporting Portal to report incidents anonymously or directly\n",
